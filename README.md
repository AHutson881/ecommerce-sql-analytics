# E-Commerce Analytics SQL + Python Project

This project simulates a complete business analysis workflow for a fictional e-commerce company. Using Python and MySQL, I generated and explored a normalized relational dataset of customers, orders, products, and returns â€” structured to reflect real-world operations and user behavior. The project includes database creation, synthetic data generation, business insights through SQL, and structured data exports in both CSV and Excel formats.

## Business Goal

**How can this e-commerce company increase revenue while reducing product returns and improving customer retention?**

This project frames all analysis and reporting around answering this core question using SQL-driven insights and operational patterns.

---

## Database Schema

- **customers** â€” customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, signup_date
- **products** â€” product_id, product_name, category, price
- **orders** â€” order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount
- **order_items** â€” order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, item_price
- **returns** â€” return_id, order_item_id, return_date, reason

---

## Key Analytical Questions

- What product categories generate the most revenue?
- Which customers have the highest lifetime value?
- What are the most returned products and why?
- How do return rates differ by product or category?
- What is the monthly revenue trend?
